In This project I have Uploaded My data Over Http Request to Azure storage Account through Azure Data Factory 
I have created Pipeline Using Azure data Factory which takes data over HTTP in JSON format and store it on my storage account as CSV files.
I have used Blob Storage
Then By using Azure DataBricks I have transformed Data using spark and stored again on storage account.
Then I have created Data base and Tables in Synaps Analytics for Further analysis.
I have also created Dashboard using Power Bi from the data.
